I hope these links help you in your research direction, We are expecting some very intuitive feature engineering as predicting stock market price is not that easy and requires a lot of research,
you can use and learn how good traders place trades because most of the times traders use just an algorithm or a strategy that is guided by logic and we can code the logic easily .

Try to see if there is any season in which a particular sector blooms, This is a very interesting thing you can present next week. Please prepare some visualizations on the basis of your stats .
Try to learn what decides the turn of the market quite often.

I would highly encourage you to play around with a market simulator and learn which of your trades did well and why, This is the best way to feel the complexity in this domain.

we are really looking forward to seeing something new analytical and unique as you have a lot of experience with maths. I would suggest trying PCA (Principal component analysis ) or any other dimension reduction techniques.
With this best of luck and stay safe, stay healthy.
